# Secondary Contact app 

## The problem 
Ever thought of saving the number of someone whom you contact only for business. Like your laundry man, or your cab driver supposed to drop you to airport. But now the contact is saved, you don't want to delete it as you might require the number later, he/she will be able to see all your whatsapp updates, or updates from any other app which uses your contact list as privacy setting.
